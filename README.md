- 👋 Hi, I’m Dan.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code to help me improve my life and help me provide for my family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, and I am enjoying it a lot. Hopefully I'll manage to retain the information I learn. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, as I don't know what I'm doing.
- 📫 How to reach me, e-mail.
